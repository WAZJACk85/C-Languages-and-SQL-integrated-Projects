Readme -    Explanation of program

This short program, creates a user interface like a registry form.  You enter in the details of a new customer/ person, including their first name, second name and email address.

When you press ok, it creates an entry in my local sqlite database system and stores these names in a visual list on the right hand side in the user interface.

I will at some point, relegate this repository down my list and update it with a more complex larger system of similar functinoality for a similar register user interface customer application.
